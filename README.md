# Chat App

## I created this chat app by following a tutorial to teach myself how to use Chat Engine and react to create a fully functioning chat app. This app challenged me as I had to learn different ways of using state. 

## Usage
To use this app you will need login as one of the users that I have already created or you can clone the repository and then go to https://chatengine.io/ and create your own project with your own users and admin. It is really easy to do and quite usefull.

## Tools used:
Axios
React
State
Netlify
Chat Engine

## Sign in
If you would like to sign in to the deployed application please use the following info:

Username: DavidJSM
Password: secret

## Deployed at:
